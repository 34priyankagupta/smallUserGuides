DISPLAY:
----------
Inline:  Can't set top and bottom margins/padding or even height/width.
Inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements but Display
Display: : block adds a line-break.allows to set a width and height on the element 

Display: none completely strips an element from the page. This means that if you apply display: none to an element, it won’t appear on your website and there will be no visible evidence of it ever having existed — meaning that the surrounding elements will treat the element as empty space and adapt accordingly.

Visibility: hidden simply hides an element from the page, while still rendering the tag in the viewport. This means that even though the element is invisible, there is still space allocated for it on the page, and the surrounding HTML elements will respect that space.

VIEWPORT
--------
The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
